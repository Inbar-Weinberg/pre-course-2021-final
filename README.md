- Special features unique to this app:
  1. Uses JsonBin to load and upload all content.
  2. Priority drop down menu was completely redesigned, using CSS and JavaScript (maybe the most challenging part of this task).
  3. For every task there is an option to mark it off. Once marked the task changes opacity. Tasks marked will remain marked 
  even if the page reloads.
  4. Tasks can be deleted in two ways. First all tasks can be deleted at once with the "Delete All" button. Second you can delete only the marked tasks using the "Delete Marked" button.
  5. Shake animation to make sure the does not input a task without text and priority.
  6. The app utilizes flex box, CSS grid, and box alignment for design.
  7. Tasks are color coded according to priority
